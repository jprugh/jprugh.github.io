	<section id="welcome">
		<p>Dear friends and family, we can't thank you enough for the love and support you've shown Abby and me over the years, and for helping us kick off our marriage in such a fun, memorable and special way. To keep the joy of that day only a click away, I built this site (from scratch!). We hope that any time you get the itch, you stop by to revisit those moments which remind us how fortunate we are to have you in our lives, and each other.</p>

	<h2>How was the honeymooon?</h2>

	<p>In a word, bangarang. Abby and I took our two-week honeymoon in September to Rome, Athens and Santorini. Highlights of our trip include dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant, a legendary sunset from the Acropolis, and the view from our hotel room in Oia.</p>
